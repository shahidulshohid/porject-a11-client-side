              <p>
                Yes. Claimants of welfare benefits such as Jobseekers Allowance,
                Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Incapacity
                Benefit and Disability Living Allowance are allowed to volunteer
                without losing their benefits. However, you must make sure that
                you are available to meet the conditions of receiving those
                benefits. We recommend that you tell your volunteer coordinator
                that you are claiming benefits, especially if there is a chance
                your situation could change at short notice, for example if you
                are seeking paid work.

                This is really up to you. You can find volunteering
                opportunities that only take one hour per month, to five days a
                week - or more. Some roles are for one-off events, some are
                short term and others might need a six month commitment. You can
                volunteer at any time of the week, day or night. While much
                volunteering takes place in office hours, you can volunteer at
                evenings and weekends too, again depending on what you want to
                do. Some organisations ask for a particular commitment from
                their volunteers while others are able to take a more flexible
                approach. Certain roles like befriending require building up
                trust with someone, which is why a certain amount of commitment
                is required. Think carefully about the amount of commitment you
                are able to give before choosing your role. Our opportunity
                search helps narrow down the opportunities that suit your life.

                Yes, of course. You are under no obligation to keep volunteering
                for an organisation if you don’t like it. But it is always worth
                talking to somebody before stopping. That could be your
                volunteer co-ordinator (if there is one), supervisor or someone
                in the organisation who is responsible for you. You can discuss
                with them why you feel unhappy and what you feel would improve
                your time as a volunteer. It is also something you may want to
                talk about with other volunteers in the organisation. You could
                either do that informally or, if your organisation has a regular
                meeting for volunteers, you could bring up any issues there. If
                you feel that something is seriously wrong, or someone is
                treating you badly, it is also worth checking whether your
                organisation has a complaints procedure. Some organisations have
                ‘volunteer agreements’ that explain expectations on both sides.{" "}

            <div className="collapse-content">
              <p>
                Not usually, no. Some volunteering opportunities require certain
                skills such as counselling which may require qualifications, but
                organisations often provide training. If particular
                qualifications are needed in order to take up the volunteering
                role, the information should be available on the organisations'
                website. Often organisations are looking for personal skills,
                such as being able to get on with a wide variety of people,
                being reliable and being enthusiastic about a particular
                interest or cause - rather than academic qualifications.

              <p>
                If you would like to give time but are unable to turn up in
                person or have little free time then online volunteering could
                be the answer. Giving time over the web is convenient and
                flexible and allows people to get involved who might otherwise
                be unable to. Online volunteering allows you to complete tasks
                from home, at work or anywhere! The tasks could be for
                organisations around the corner, overseas or they may exist only
                on the internet.

              <p>
                Yes. It's an increasingly popular way of volunteering and you
                can search for home based opportunities on our website. Example
                opportunities are telephone befriending or some people combine
                their hobby with volunteering such as knitters making blankets
                and baby clothes to be sold for charity. For specific
                information on online volunteering, see Q8 - What about online
